Getting a 100% remote job at a startup without a background check can be a challenge, but you can improve your chances by targeting the right kind of companies and using specific strategies. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you in your search:

1. Target Smaller Startups
Early-Stage Startups: These companies are often focused on growth and may not have established background check processes. You can find these through platforms like:
AngelList (now Wellfound): Popular for startup job listings.
LinkedIn: Use advanced filters to target small, early-stage startups.
Startup directories: Explore directories like Crunchbase or TechCrunch to find smaller startups.

3. Networking
Join startup communities like:
Indie Hackers
Product Hunt
Startup Grind
Participate in discussions, connect with startup founders, and inquire about opportunities. Founders in these communities often hire based on trust and skill demonstration rather than formal background checks.
